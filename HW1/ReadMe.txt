I've used Python3 for this homework. The entry script is `main.py`. Running the script could be achieved by running
`python3 main.py` (this is the command added into the `run.sh` bash script).

For generating a graph of the decision tree I've used the python module `mathplotlib`. In case this module is not
available, the script will still print the results, but won't show the graph.
